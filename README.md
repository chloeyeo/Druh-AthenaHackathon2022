Druh is a web application to connect Ukrainian child refugees in the UK.

Parents can log in and add their childrens' information under any parent's account (allowing accessibility for single mothers and fathers),

and use it to connect to other families and view their childrens' information.

Parents can also message each other to arrange meetings/playing times between their kids, and more.
